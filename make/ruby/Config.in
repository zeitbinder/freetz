		Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on
		simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural
		to read and easy to write.

		Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro "matz"
		Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk,
		Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional
		programming with imperative programming. He has often said that he is
		"trying to make Ruby natural, not simple". Ruby is simple in appearance,
		but is very complex inside.

		http://www.ruby-lang.org/

		This package contains
		  - the Ruby interpreter,
		  - the interactive Ruby console (irb),
		  - the full Ruby API, i.e. all *.rb modules,
		  - all *.so extension libraries. These may
		    also be linked in statically or not built at all, but there is no
		    menuconfig option for it. Do this yourself according to Ruby's
		    README if you like.
		I.e. in total we have about 5.5 MB of installed files of which you may
		strip away unneeded ones from packages/ruby-1.8.6 manually as you see
		fit. Do this after "make precompiled", but before "make".

		By the way: Ruby modules are well compressible, so the full monty just
		needs about 1.3 MB inside the firmware image. So even if you are not
		working with Downloader CGI or NFS root, Ruby may well fit into your
		image along with several other packages, if you have an 8 MB box.

		ATTENTION: You should have installed the same Ruby version on your host
		in order to be able to successfully build the target version!
